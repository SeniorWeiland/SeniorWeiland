👋 Hi, I’m Tobias Weiland. Welcome to my GitHub Profile. I've just finished my masters degree in Automotive Systems at the Technical University in Berlin. 
In my final thesis i was collaborating with the German Aerospace Center (DLR) on a predictive maintanance topic in the railway sector using ML methods. This experience and various modules at the university ignited my passion intro Machine Learning and data-based modelling.
